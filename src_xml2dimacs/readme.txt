A binary constraint satisfaction problem (BCSP) consists in determining an assignment of
values to variables that is compatible with a set of constraints. A BCSP is a Combinatorial Constraint Programming problem.
XCSP3 is an XML format used to define Combinatorial Constraint Problems instances. Large number of problems families are defined using it.
The software xml2dimacs transforms XCSP3 files into a graph.
