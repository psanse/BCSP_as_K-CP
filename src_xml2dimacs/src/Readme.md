# Source folder


This folder contains the source code of the program that generates a dimacs graph from an XML file in XCSP3 format.

It also contains an example of Cmake configuration file. It assumes that the source program is located in a directory called xml2dimacs at the route of the XCSP3 C++ parser folder and the source file has the name xml2dimacs.cc.

A copy of the file XCSP3PrintCallbacks.h has to be on the xml2dimacs directory.
