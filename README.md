# Bfilt dataset and converters

This site contains a release of the algorithm *Bfilt* (as well as the dataset of BCSP instances in XCSP3 format tested) described in the following paper:

>*A new branch-and-filter exact algorithm for binary constraint satisfaction problems* 
by Pablo San Segundo, Fabio Furini and Rafael Le√≥n. European Journal of Operational Research, 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.09.014)

In addition, the converter from XCSP3 to DIMACS format and the converter from DIMACS to MiniZinc format is provided. Detailed instructions for use are included inside the corresponding folders.

This software is for academic purposes only, see also the file LICENSE  provided.

Two complete families of instances in DIMACS format (part of the dataset of the mentioned paper) are also provided. The remaining families are not available owing to space requirements, but may be obtained using the corresponding converters.

Finally, a **Linux binary** is also available in the *bin* folder (instructions for use are inside), with a few sample instances.
